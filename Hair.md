# Hair Type

- Very full
- Super Thick
- Volume easy
- Puff ball (especially after showers)
- Scalp takes a long time to get oily (dry(dandruff))

**Coarse**

# Goal

I need to de-volumize my hair for a flatter look so my hair falls close to my head. I need to provide oil to my scalp to keep it hydrated and to evenly distribute oil to my hair for weight and to eliminate frizz.

# Methods
- No Shampoo
	- No shampoo is the idea of taking shampoo (strips your hair of its oils) out of your routine.
	- This allows your scalp to eventually product oils that stay at consistent levels, moisturising your scalp and hydrating your hair. 
- 'Weighty' products
	- Oils and heavier products will work great at giving your hair weight and supplementing your hair with oil while your scalp regenerates its natural oils.
