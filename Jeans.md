Jeans are a type of pant/trouser that is made from denim or dungaree. Often the pant is of a blue colour referred to as "blue jeans". Traditionally, jeans were dyed with natural indigo dye. Most denim is now dyed with synthetic indigo.

# Types
## Pre-Shrunk
These jeans do not shrink after purchase, allowing you to purchase a correctly fitted size.
## Shrink-To-Fit (STF)
Shrink to fit type jeans will shrink a variable amount specified by the retailer/manufacturer after a wash. On average STFs shrink 1-2 inches in the waist and 2-3 inches in the inseam so the rule of thumb is +1 from your usual size in the waistband and +3 in the inseam for a comfortable middle of the road fit. So if you normally wear a 31 or 32 I'd guess a 32 would be slimmer on you while a 33 would be more of a regular fit.
