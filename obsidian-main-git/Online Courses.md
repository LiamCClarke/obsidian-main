## Course Cycle (Online Business Engine)

To have a successful online course business, we must ensure we are adhearing to a cycle that returns customers back to the course. This helps increase revenue but also returning customers in a case of a niche market with a smaller audience.

- Course
	- The first stage is creating the course
- Enrollment
	- This is the act of consumers enrolling on your course generating you revenue
- Transformation
	- Transformation is when you transform your enrolled consumers into a better self and leave them satisfied by the contents of your course
- Ambassadors
	- The transoformed consumers become your ambassadors and refer your course to new people and potentially enroll on further courses
	- Therefore, returning back to the first point "Course"

## Most Profitable Course

These are the main points you must ensure are being met to create the most profitable course.

- Dont copy others work if the market is saturated
	- Most consumers of courses will seek niche expertise, it will be extremely difficult to stand out in a saturated market next to people with dispalyed proffesionalism
	- Not everything you create will be unique, if there arent many then evaluate your copetition and fill the gaps they arent
