Affiliate marketing comes in many shapes and sizes, from an abstract point of view, affiliate marketing is the idea of promoting someone else's product and recieving commision for the sale. You will earn commission for the initial sale, in some cases you can even earn money for each recurring sale.

One approach to affiliate marketing is having your own large audience (YouTube) and encouraging your audience to sign up to the target website and earn you earn commission. This is through purely organic traffic and often yield greater success as you would advertise a product in the scope of your channel, that way you are hitting your target audience. 

Another approach for someone who doesn't have access to such a large audiences attention, is through a affiliate service such as **ClickBank** or **PartnerStack**. These websites list companies offering their affiliate program.
