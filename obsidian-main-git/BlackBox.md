### Products
#### Basic Filters
##### Categories
##### Monthly Revenue
Monthly Revenue is how much a product is making in revenue (not profit) over the course of a month. A great filter to display already successful products
**Minimum:** £5000
##### Price
Price is a essential filter, a product is often profitable by about 50% but then add fba fees which arent percentage based but rather a fixed price, a cheaper product is going to be hit the hardest. Amazons fees are basically a minimum of £2.50. A maximum is good as well, as a starter you arent going to be able to buy expensive products at bulk, and 99% profit margins dont exist.
**Minimum:** 12
**Maximum:** 50
##### Review Count
Review Count is a filter that determines competitiveness, you dont want to be selling in the shadow of a 4000 review listing
**Maximum:** <500, 300?
#### Advanced Filters
##### Monthly Sales
Unlike *Monthly Revenue*, mothly sales can specify the amount of units being sold. This is good if you havent got the budget to buy too many units, or I like the idea of a higher unit selling product, that way you are likely to get more reviews and sales arent going to be so skewed if you are a few sales down. Monthly Revenue should be used along side this
##### Best Seller Rank
Best seller rank is a measurement of sales by Amazon, a general idea is that if a product is BSR - 50,000, they recieve a sale for every 50,000 sold in that category. This isnt always correct as a score of 1 would mean 100% of sales. Use of other filters like Revenue and sales will often filter out high BSR products but its a good measure to add this filter as well to remove anomolies
**Maximum:** 50,000
##### Number of Sellers
Number of sellers is a good way to eliminate big name brands that are being wholesaled, a private label listing which we are scouting should only have 1 seller, though we should also account for amazon warehouse (a returned product), so 2 is fine.
**Maximum:** 2
##### Number of Images
This filter should only be used when scoping bad listings, the lower the number of images the more opportunity there is to present this product better and win customers. I will go over this more in a poor listing finder
##### Variation
Variation is a essential filter, variants and mess with BlackBox results and its diffucult to measure sales between the variants. It also becomes increasingly difficult to source certain variants and pay Amazon space for stock that isnt moving. That said I dont mind having 2 variants to increase successful products
**Maximum:** 2
##### Weight
FBA fees are calculated through the size and weight of the product, ideally we want a very light product, you should atleast filter it with a maximum filter so we arent getting domestic appliances and weights in the search results
**Maximum:** 4lb?

### Keywords
#### Basic Filters
##### Search Volume
Search Volume is how many people are searching for this particular keyword, its essential for understanding consumer demand and making sure your niche/category is in demand. Its also a good indicator of potential sales
**Minimum:** 10,000?
##### Monthly Revenue
Monthly Revenue is how much a keyword is making in revenue (not profit) over the course of a month. A great filter to display successful demanding keywords
**Minimum:** £10,000?
##### Price
Price is a essential filter, a keyword is often profitable but then add fba fees which arent percentage based but rather a fixed price, a cheaper product is going to be hit the hardest. Amazons fees are basically a minimum of £2.50. A maximum is good as well, as a starter you arent going to be able to buy expensive products at bulk, and 99% profit margins dont exist.
**Minimum:** 12
**Maximum:** 50
##### Review Count
Review Count is a filter that determines competitiveness, you dont want to be selling in the shadow of a 4000 review listing
**Maximum:** <500, 300?
##### Word Count
Word count is a great filter to find niches and consumer search terms, given its responsible for how high you rank on a consumers page you want to be able to find keywords with high volume and low competition. Every keyword that is one word will be over saturated, the more qords required the less competition but also less search volume
**Minimum:** 2?
#### Advanced Filters
Most of these filters are the same as the Products tab, any keyword exclusive filters will be mentioned here
##### Competitor Revenue
Competitor Revenue is a great filter that allows you to identify keywords that have competitors/sellers within that keyword search term, making a certain amoutn of revenue, you can also specify how many sellers. You would ideally want sellers making a large amount of revenut and   more than one if its not a super niche term, that way there is room for yourself
**Revenue:** £7,500?
**Minimum Sellers:** 2?
##### Competitor Reviews
Again you can filter how many sellers within the keywords have a certain amount of reviews and how many sellers fit this criteria
**Reviews:** 
**Minimum:**
