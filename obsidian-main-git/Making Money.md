# Getting Started

As of today, December 20th 2022, there are a variety of methods to make money. In this document I plan making detailed notes on these methods and how likely/fast it will take to achieve **success** in these methods.

## Methods

- E-Commerce
- [[Amazon FBA]] 
- [[Dropshipping]]
- [[YouTube]]
- Photography
- Online Education
- Modelling
- Trading/Investing
- Real-Estate
- [[Website]]
- [[Selling Digital Products]]
- [[Affiliate Marketing]]
- [[Agency]]
- [[Online Clothing]]

## Ranking

Once I have conducted thorough research into all of these methods, I will provide a link to a ranking system and measure the efficiency of all of these methods. It will be slighly bias as some methods above are aimed towards once you have semi-made it, as they have a large initial cost like [[Real-Estate]], where I may be more bias towards developing a website as I have a Bsc in Computer Science.
