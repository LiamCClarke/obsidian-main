Dropshipping is a littel different than what I expected, I originally thought it was making a bulk purchase on **AliBaba** or **AliExpress** and then proceeding to sell these products. This made me hesititant as there is room for failure in selling/marketing.
Dropshipping is actually a business model where you the owner (me), only makes a purchase of the product when a order has been made. Therefore, you never lose money as you only order to order and when things become more serious you can become to bulk order for better margins!

## Marketing

The face of making money online is currently dropshipping, this means a lot of people are trying it, thus causing a saturated market. To be successful you must correctly market your product, this in its self required a lot of research, though opening the doors to a less saturated online business called [[Social Media Marketing Agency]].

[[YouTube shorts]] is an essential method of generating organic traffic, it costs nothing except time and is a lot more effective than regular videos.

## Products

The key to success is the ability to identify trending products and act on a upcoming or existing trend/demand, though there are many other factors you must consider. Despite a products demand, the market could simply be over saturated, too niche or not appeal to the audience your adverts will find.

A seaon can also be responsible for a product trend, a good starting point is working around the [[Seasonal Product Trends]]. As we are currently heading into a recession, a good motive is to sell products consumers need or will feel inclined to need rather than want.

## Customer Satisfaction

Customers are less inclined to cancel a order when they:
- Recieve tracking information with orders
	- Auto updates every 3 days?
	- Auto updates when major update to delivery status?

## Suppliers

Suppliers are mandatory as you must fulfill orders made by the customers to make profit... duh. The most common supplier is **AliExpress**, base din Asia, the website offers cheap goods that can have a great markup. Unfortunatley I am base din the UK and asia is on the opposite side of the world, this means shipping times might be a big downside

CJDropshipping is a supplier that is similar to AliExpress, CJ can have faster and more customizable shipping times, and even cheaper prices.

SourcinBox have dropshipping and wholesale products available. You can also import products from AliExpress and they will give you delivery and price estimate

Private Suppliers, these seem to be the way to go, you can achieve cheaper costs, fast shipping and  better quality
