# Digital Products

## Overview / Advantages

Digital products is a extremely effective way or making passive income and having a wide spread on the market, there are plenty of methods to generate and offer digital products. One of the many advantages of selling digital products is:
 - There is next to **no fees**, to make the product, sell the product or distribute the product.
 - You have a **unlimited inventory**, once the work has been done, you can distribute your product as much as you would like generating an uncapped income.
 - You have a **Global Audience**, you arent tied to a location at all and can cater you rproduct to anyone in the world and adapt to their needs.
 - **Incredible Margins**, your only expense in most cases is time, ( *time is money sooner or later, just not right now :)* ), this means your customer price is your profit!
 - Finally, **Easy to Scale**, given you can start fee-free you can find your niche/gap and then branch into [[E-Commerce]] rather than going head first into a failed idea that has **fees**!!

## Types of Digital Products

 - eBooks
 - [[Online Courses]]
 - Membership Business
 - Templates

## Platforms

The one factor you have to consider, is the platform that you will use to market and sell your digital product. This is really down to the type or product you will be selling and what platform has the biggest audience tailored towards your product. For example eBooks are mostly viewed on the amazon platform.

## Conclusion

Making digital products is a great and effective method of generating income risk free with no upfront cost, given its demand and the possibility of finding your niche, the possibility is endless. I feel this approach can be good to identify a [[E-Commerce]] opportunity, though [[E-Commerce]] has **greater risks**, I feel it can easily yield **greater results**
