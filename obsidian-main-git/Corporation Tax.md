Corporation Tax is the **Tax** you hear everyone talking about as a business, as far as you are concerned, there is no other tax. If you own a limited company, you will be required to file for corporation tax, I say file and not pay as you don't have to pay any if you don't meet a certain threshold.

You **MUST** register for corporate tax when you start doing business or restart a dormant business. I haven't, so we are about to figure out if I am going to jail or not.

Its important that keep accounting records for everything payed out and everything payed in. Records of expenses help with both claiming back [[VAT]] and deducting [[Corporation Tax]]

You must pay/report any taxes by your deadline, this is usually 9 months and 1 day after the end of your 'accounting period'. The 'accounting period' is usually the same 12 months as the financial year.
