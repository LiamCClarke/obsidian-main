No Shampoo is the idea of eliminating shampoo from your hair routine and returning back to mechanical methods of cleaning your hair. This removes all harsh chemicals from your scalp and often fixes a lot of issues with hair.
# Should you do it?
## Type of hair
### Fine
Fine hair is a lot thinner and prone to becoming oily/greasy over a shorter period of time compared to medium/coarse hair. 
People with fine hair usually don't benefit from no-shampoo because their scalp produces oils too fast and rely on shampoo to reduce/remove the oil from their hair.

**Probably not**
### Medium
Medium hair is the default, you don't really have to do much to make your hair nice. Your scalp produces oils at a average rate and doesn't really become greasy all too quick.
No-shampoo could work for you though your hair will inevitably get greasy until your scalp hopefully adjusts and produces less oils.

**Maybe**
### Coarse
Coarse hair is is a thick and often dense type of hair. The scalp produces oil at a slower rate and you will find your hair being frizzy and dry between every shampoo, and after shampoo you become a frizz bomb (This is me).
Given shampoo is literally your enemy and not helping you one bit, there is no reason to continue using it, even if you suffer from health problems, they can be solved with natural shampoo-free methods as mentioned below.

**YES!**

# Scalp Health
If you find you should be doing no-shampoo then your scalp health should increase right? Some people rely on shampoo's to cure their scalp issues they are facing, the biggest example being dandruff.
## Dandruff
Dandruff is usually flaky skin from the scalp that sits on and fall from the hair. People often use store-bought and prescription shampoo's to combat dandruff and fear what will happen when they stop using the shampoo.
### Normal
TODO:
### Fungal (Seborrheic dermatitis)
Fungal dandruff is often caused by a type of eczema called seborrheic dermatitis which makes parts of the skin red and flaky. People  who suffer from this will be prescribed a shampoo with an ingredient called "ketoconazole" which does in fact work from experience, though at the cost of stripping every micro-molecule of moisture from you hair. If you have coarse hair and fungal dandruff, they you may feel you have to have damaged dry hair in order to stop your dandruff, but there are natural methods of combating this type of dandruff. 
#### Methods
##### Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)
Apple cider vinegar is the go-to suggestion for combating dandruff naturally, though I wouldn't suggest it for fungal dandruff. Fungal infections feed on acid and ACV is an acidic base, so you should try other methods like baking soda

**Try to avoid**
#### Baking Soda
Baking soda is an alterative to ACV that isn't acid based. An efficient method of applying baking soda is:
1. Pour a good amount of baking soda into a glass
2. Wet you hair, then fill the glass till the baking soda is covered
3. Let the baking soda sit while you wash yourself
4. Check to see if the baking soda is of a paste consistency
5. Use the paste on the roots of your hair
