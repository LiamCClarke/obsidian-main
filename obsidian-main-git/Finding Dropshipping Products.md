This is the starting point of your dropshipping journey, once you have found your product and are confident with it, everything from website to marketing will follow and fall in place.
# Find Already Trending Products

## MyAdFinder

MyAdFinder is a plugin for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Firefox, it also works with browsers that use chrome extensions like Brave. The plugin will allow you to automatically harvest advertisement from Facebook. Given most dropshippers advertise on Facebook, it can be an excellent resource to spot niches or upcoming products.

## Amazon New Releases

Amazon new releases allows you to find new products and see reviews of the item. This resource hasnt been my greatest and is pretty useless right now unless weighted hula hoops blow up in the newt few months and I kms.

## TikTok

I believe this to be the most efficient and controlled approach but it is a lot riskier, you will create a new tiktok account and search for terms dropshippers will use like "TikTokMadeMeBuyIt", scroll throught his content and like the posts, from now on your content will consist of dropshippers. This will allow you to find new and trending products and see consumers reviews.

This approach is riskier as this product is already being dropshipped so you must steal the idea and market it better.
