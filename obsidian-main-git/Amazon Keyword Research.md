## Magnet (Helium 10)

Magnet is an incredible keyword research tool that requires a starting keyword presented by the user, once presented Magnet lists related keywords and tons of useful statistics with each keyword. These keywords can be used to identify lesser performing keywords and strong keywords surrounding your product.
### Magnet IQ

Magnet IQ is a statistic provided by Magnet on each keyword, this statistic is a score generated from Magnet based on a few factors. Magnet compares the amount of search volume a keyword gets versus the amount of competing products and a few other factors like the amount of products advertised under that keyword but the other two are the main factors to generate the score. This score is the main metric I use to calculate if a keyword is good enough to find a product to sell, though a keyword may have a high IQ score but just have a really low volume to competing ratio, you must find a line to draw for search volume and profitability.

### Cerebro (Helium 10)

Cerebro is a reverse keyword look-up tool to see what keywords your competitor is using, and how well they are working for him. Its also a good tool to find long chain keywords that might be good or to see what path the automatic campaign might be pushing a listing towards.
