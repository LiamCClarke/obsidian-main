Youtube is a vague term for such a wide reach business, YouTube in my opinion is the heart of online business. Every popular dropshipper will have a youtube as its another method to generate massive amounts of traffic towards your sites or digital products, as well as the ad revenue generated from the videos.
I say YouTube is vague as there is different approaches/models to generating revenue from YouTube, some aspire to generate large audiences with little monetization like shorts, to direct traffic to digital products, and some will even take a identity free approach. Others will focus on generating content that is ad friendly and make money through youtube rather than other third party methods
