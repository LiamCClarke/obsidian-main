### Best Sellers Rank

The best sellers rank can be found on every products information, the products that do the best selling are products who have the lower best sellers rank as #1 is the best. A recommended level is get a product below 100,000 rank

### Weight & Size

You want your product to be as light and small as possible, the heavier or larger the product, the greater the **FBA fees**. Shipping cost are greater for products that weight more than 2 pounds

### Seasonal Products

Its not recommended that you FBA seasonal products as profit margins can be misleading and only sell certain times of the year. If you are unable to identify whether a product is seasonal, you can type the keywords into **Google Trends** or **ExplodingTopics** and measure demand

### Amazon.com/ internetfamous

This link is only available for the US store however, it can be an excellent tool to measure consumer demand and trends to reveal winning products. This URL is the internet trends available on amazon, these are often measured through YouTube and TikTok. An initial glance will show all these products are making large sums of money and dominating the market, there is no room for us next to these products.

The only approach avilable to make this work is to somehow filter these products to find new listings, this can be done by scrolling down towards the bottom and clicking more results, there you have filter oprions in the top left.

## Delivery

Its no doubt you will be getting some form of goods delivered when you are selling on Amazon. In a perfect world, you can simply get your goods delivered straight to Amazon. I first noticed how this was a problem on my first shipment, I paid half the invoice and I loved the price, I then mention I am shipping to amazon and in the last half of the invoice, another $90 gets thrown on. This is the import Fee.

See, if your receiving destination isn't a trade partner with the sending destination, you will have to pay some form of fee. This fee consists of a Duty fee and a tax fee, both of which depend on your declared value. It gets even worse, the delivery cost is also part of the declared value. 

### Types of Delivery
#### DDU (Delivery Duty Unpaid)

DDU is when you don't pay your supplier the tax/duty, but once your goods have been delivered, you will be contacted by the courier demanding the fees payed. The fees will end up the exact same

#### DDP (Delivery Duty Paid)

DDP is the opposite of DDU, when you pay your supplier you will also the duty/tax fee. They will then pay/sort this on your behalf.

When you pay this fee, you will often be paying the **Duty Fee**, **VAT** and **Customs Clearance**

#### DAP

DAP means the seller is only responsible for transportation costs, but us the buyer are responsible for customs clearance and import taxes
